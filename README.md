# Wordpress REST API with Angular SPA

### [Wordpress v5.4.2](https://wordpress.com/)
37% of the web is built on WordPress. More bloggers, small businesses, and Fortune 500 companies use WordPress than all other options combined. Join the millions of people that call WordPress.com home.

### [Angular v10.0.2](https://angular.io)
Learn one way to build applications with Angular and reuse your code and abilities to build apps for any deployment target. For web, mobile web, native mobile and native desktop.

Directory: `wp-angular`

## Why? 
As a full-time fullstack developer who works on complex web applications I find it frustrating to find good, re-usable boilerplate projects that simplify the front & backend processes for side projects, freelance and hobbyist projects I like to work on. Sometimes a full-fledged framework is too much when Aunt Carole is asking for a nice website where she can post stories about her kitties for her fans.

## How to use it
Clone it: 

`git clone https://github.com/drewpayment/wordpress-angular`

Inside `wp-angular` run: 

`ng build`

Host your wordpress site with your local dev environment... 

I highly suggest [Laravel Valet](https://github.com/laravel/valet) if you're on mac OS for sheer speed and ease-of-use. From your root working directory that you cloned: 

```
valet park 
valet link
valet open
```

You should then see your default browser open and you will be presented with the Wordpress Installer screen. Here you will go through the familiar Wordpress setup (entering database information from Valet).
